## Exploring Consciousness

 I carry a responsibility to my own consciousness to explore it to the fullest 
 by delving into it head first without understanding what it is. I do not think
 that this responsibility is shared by my peers who self censor their speech and 
 thought. </br>

 Without exploring my consciousness, I will be stuck in a perpetual state of grief, 
 irritation and a hunger for knowledge that knows no bound. </br>
